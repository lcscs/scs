| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the lcscs software and dependencies.

To build lcscs from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download lcscs Source](01_download-lcscs-source.md)
2. [Build lcscs Binaries](02_build-lcscs-binaries.md)
3. [Install lcscs Binaries](03_install-lcscs-binaries.md)
4. [Test lcscs Binaries](04_test-lcscs-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall lcscs](05_uninstall-lcscs.md)

[[info | Building lcscs is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to lcscs, it is recommended that you install the [lcscs Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
