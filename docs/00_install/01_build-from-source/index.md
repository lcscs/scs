content_title: Build lcscs from Source

[[info | Building lcscs is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to lcscs, it is recommended that you install the [lcscs Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

lcscs can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build lcscs using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | lcscs Installation Recommended]]
| After building lcscs successfully, it is highly recommended to install the lcscs binaries from their default build directory. This copies the lcscs binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/lcscs/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the lcscs release version.
